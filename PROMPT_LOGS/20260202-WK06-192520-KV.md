## Prompt Log

### 19:25:20 - User Prompt

```
OK, so apparently we have a couple of new issues that are still part and parcel to what we've been working on. I started a deploy, I'm sorry, a make deploy VPC, it worked fine. I did a make destroy VPC, that 2 worked just fine. Then I tried to make deploy -all, and I ran out of memory.
So it seems to me we're going to need to change things up just a little bit:
1. The bastion will definitely be something that I will start and stop as needed
2. The bastion needs to be at a 1GB memory size. If you think it needs to be bigger than that, let me know
3. I think we want to avoid using an elastic IP on this and instead use a dynamic IP. Our deploy bastion can tell us what the IP number is. Our validate or verify or whatever that middle tier thing was that we were doing can also give us that IP. If we do a start bastion, then again it can return to us the same information that you get in a deploy, so we'll always know what it's going to be at that moment. So we don't really need to spend money on a IP that's not running.
Let me know if you think I'm crazy on any of this.
```
