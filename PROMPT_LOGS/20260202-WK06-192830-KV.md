## Prompt Log

### 19:28:30 - User Prompt

```
One more item I overlooked. I would also like us to set the vm.swappiness value at 10 instead of the default of 60. Also, I have already initiated the delete bastion or destroy bastion, so we should be fine when we're ready to take the next step again. 
```
