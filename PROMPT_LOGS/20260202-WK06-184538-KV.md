## Prompt Log

### 18:45:38 - User Prompt

```
ok - I am in the bastion and have authenticated claude - It runs really slowly. and keeps dying. I suspicion it's a memory issue. However, before I increase the size of the box, it might be a good idea to give the box a bit of swap. This would definitely be something I think that we would want to add into user data so that it generates a 2GB swap space. You might give me what those commands are so I can do it manually for right now. 
```
