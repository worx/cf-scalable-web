## Prompt Log

### 14:11:26 - User Prompt

```
I have finished your steps 1 & 2
Question: you have settled on t4g.small (2G) and mentioned PHP compilation. I have been doing this process now for years and always used a 1G instance. I don't believe there is any PHP compilation that I am doing. Could you dig a bit deeper into this and explain the need for PHP compilation? I was only aware that we were pulling PHP extensions and I was never aware that a compilation took place. That could be an oversight on my part.... but now it just confuses me.
```
