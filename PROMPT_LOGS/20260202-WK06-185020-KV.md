## Prompt Log

### 18:50:20 - User Prompt

```
Some additional issues have come to light:
- I've done the `git clone` and tried to run the `make`. The `make` fails because it can't find the `.env` file. Which apparently was `git` ignored, so it didn't get pulled. That should be easy enough to fix. Or maybe we don't want to fix it. I don't know that we want to pass environments around like that. But anyway, that is a first issue, so if we're not going to pass it, we should somehow prompt ourselves to remember that we need it. Documentation, you know, you can't write the code, at least write about the code.
- The AWS config or configure, whatever it is, the `.AWS` folder that sits off of a person's home folder. That `.AWS` folder needs to be created so that we can actually log into this and execute all these `make` commands that are executing all these AWS commands. We installed AWS but we didn't think about all the setup and configuration we needed to do. So we need to give that some thought. Documentation, something.
