## Prompt Log

### 10:56:40 - User Prompt

```
it worked - deploy-bastion updated the role, deploy-all has run successfully

I believe we have a working, base system now. So, what is next on the TODO? I'm thinking we should start on the BuildImage stacks for php and nginx. also, for the purposes of keeping my brain in gear on this, just want to make sure that vpc & iam are required, but storage, database & cache are both optional, and order independent. In other words, we don't have to do them in that order. We could do just storage while we're working on the Nginx and PHP so that we know that they can see the necessary common storage. And then we can add database in when we want to actually install a Drupal and do some testing and of course the cache in when we want to do that same but since database and cache and storage are each monetary based deployments deploying them as we need them instead of all together is something I'm just trying to get a handle on.
