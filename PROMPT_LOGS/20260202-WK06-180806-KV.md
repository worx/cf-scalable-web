## Prompt Log

### 18:08:06 - User Prompt

```
OK - A few minor modifications. Let's talk about Make for just a minute. We currently have a deploy bastion and a destroy bastion. And I don't suspect this is taking up very much disk space at all. - I checked, and it looks like it's 20. Probably way more than we actually need, but for now, we'll leave it at that. I am thinking, however, that we might need to add a couple of more endpoints into our Make regarding the bastion and that would be a start bastion and a stop bastion. That way, we don't even have to have the machine running except when we actually think we need it. As cheap as it is, it's not like we are going to freak out if we forget to stop it, but we should at least have it coated so that we can handle that. 
Now let's talk about the UserData. This is a block of first-time executions when the Linux box starts. One of the things that I would like it to do, which we have not handled so far, is to set a root password. Now, I don't want to put a root password in clear text inside the CloudFormation, and I'm wondering if we can set up a root password in config that gets saved to a secret and gets pulled down by some process that can be executed as part of user data to set that password. Of course, it would be even better if we could do that in some kind of a TUI where we capture the password somebody wants to use and place it directly inside of a secret so that it's not stored in config anywhere. But we don't have to go that far. 

And finally I did try the SSM call and am providing you the execution of the call along with the output because it didn't work. So if you could take a look at that and let me know what you think.
