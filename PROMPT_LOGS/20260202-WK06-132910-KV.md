## Prompt Log

### 13:29:10 - User Prompt

```
I believe I will select Option 2 - 
But, that begs the quesiton about the ZI-bastion.pem
How do we notify the next deploy attempt that we've already got a key? Do we have a key? Is there a key pair already in existence. And if we run the destroy bastion, will that destroy the key? None of this is right or wrong, I'm just trying to figure out what to expect here. If we don't need to keep the zi-bastion.pem here locally because we're going to redeploy everything, which means recreating the key pair, I have no problem with that. If the key pair is not going to be redeployed, I have no problem with that either. I'm just trying to learn. 
```
